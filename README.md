## Project Description

For this first project, I have decided to create the game of hangman using my skills learned so far in class. I plan to set up an array of ransom words the user can use if they are playing alone and also an input box so they can input their own word. They will have 7 chances to get the word correct. There will be a keyboard so they can choose letters. After a letter has been chosen, it will go dark so they can't pick it anymore. If they pick the correct letter, that letter will show up in the word for all instances of that letter. As each wrong letter is chosen, I body part will appear for the hangman. Once the player is out of turns, they will see a game over screen and have to try again. If they win, they will see a game over screen celebrating the win.
