Class Notes:
Create a game of Hangman to work on Desktop AND mobile webpages
    Research the proper use of CSS for mobile
Suggested to work with Modals.
    Research these ideas.
    
Game must haves:
    Render in the browser
    Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
    Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
    Be deployed online, using Github Project pages and/or to a custom domain.
    Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
    Show a good commit history with frequent commits
    Demonstrate something we haven't learned so far in this class
    Submit a hosted copy of this project through github
    the README should include an explanation of the technologies used, approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems and anything else pertinent to anyone who wanted to fork this repo.

The instructors should be the LAST people you ask for help.  Use your peers and google before you turn to the instructors.


Start by: 
    Breaking the project down into different components
    Use your development tools - console.log everything.
    Don't procrastinate!
    Commit early and often
    Make the code work first, then come back and clean it up. 
    ***Don't obsess about CSS right off the bat, that can be cleaned up later.
    Consult documentation resources like W3 schools
    Don't be afraid to write code you know you have to remove later.

Hangman
    Have a player enter a word that will be guessed during the game. The word is then hidden and represented by blank spaces. The second player then chooses letters, which are revealed if present.

Bonus:

    Add timer-based scoring
    Track scores across games (even if the page is reloaded)

Presentations
    We expect everyone to attend all presentations in their entirety and will provide breaks between each session.

    This means no working on your code while others are presenting. This is your chance to ask others how they tackled their project.

    Each session of presentations will be science-fair style. Several people will set up at a given time, and other students will walk around asking questions like:

    What would you do differently?
    What are you most proud of?
    What would you do next?
    How did you plan your project?
    What did you learn?


Homework for the weekend:
